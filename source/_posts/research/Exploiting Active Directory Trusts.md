## One Way Trust

This is also known as one direction trust where users or groups in trusted domain can access resources in trusting domain but the reverse is not true. For example in a forest alex.local there is a child domain development.alex.local and there is another forest dhital.local which has its child domain management.dhital.local. If development.alex.local is configured to trust management.dhital.local then development.alex.local is the trusting domain wheares management.dhital.local is the trusted domain so users/groups in management.dhital.local can authenticate and access resources of development.alex.local but vice versa is not true.
