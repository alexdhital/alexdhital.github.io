# Overview
In active directory trust is a relationship between two domain or forest which allows users or groups of one domain or forest to authenticate and access resources of another domain or forest or vice versa. 

## One Way Trust

This is also known as one direction trust where users or groups in trusted domain can access resources in trusting domain but the reverse is not true. For example in a forest alex.local there is a child domain development.alex.local and there is another forest dhital.local which has its child domain management.dhital.local. If development.alex.local is configured to trust management.dhital.local then development.alex.local is the trusting domain wheares management.dhital.local is the trusted domain so users/groups in management.dhital.local can authenticate and access resources of development.alex.local but vice versa is not true.

## Two way trust(Bidirectional trust)

Two way trust or also called as bi-directional trust is a trust relationship where users or groups of one domain or forest can access each other's resources. This type of trust is automatically created between domains inside a forest. For example in the above diagram The root domain is alex.local which has two child domains development.alex.local and finance.alex.local. Both development and finance can access each other resources as well as can access resource in alex.local itself.

**Note:** In a forest if one domain is compromised the entire forest can be compromised since domains inside a forest has bi-directional trust with each other. eg: If management.alex.local is compromised due to bi-directional parent child trust alex.local can be compromised.
